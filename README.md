# Pearl Grading System

An automated computer vision system for grading Tahitian pearls by size, shape, and color. Built for remote pearl farms with offline-first operation.

## Features

- **Automated Measurements**
  - Size measurement (±0.1mm accuracy)
  - Shape classification (Round, Semi-Round, Button, Drop, Baroque, Circled)
  - Color analysis (Peacock, Green, Blue, Aubergine, Cherry, etc.)

- **Hybrid Workflow**
  - Automated objective measurements
  - Manual input for subjective grading (luster, surface quality)
  - 40-50% faster than traditional manual grading

- **Offline-First Design**
  - Works without internet connectivity
  - SQLite database for local storage
  - Sync capability when connection available

- **Hardware**
  - Arduino Portenta H7 with Vision Shield
  - Rugged, low-power design for remote locations
  - Salt-air and humidity resistant

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Arduino IDE (for Portenta H7 programming)
- Arduino Portenta H7 with Vision Shield
- microSD card (for image storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kylanj7/pearl-grading-system.git
cd pearl-grading-system
```

2. Install Python dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Upload Arduino sketch to Portenta H7
```bash
# Open capture/capture.ino in Arduino IDE
# Select Board: Arduino Portenta H7
# Upload to device
```

4. Initialize the system
```bash
python grader.py
# Select option 1 to run calibration
```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Capture Images**
   - Place pearl on white background with calibration marker
   - Press button on Arduino to capture
   - Image saved to SD card as IMG_XXXX.jpg

2. **Transfer Images**
   - Copy images from SD card to `data/images/` directory

3. **Run Grading**
   ```bash
   python grader.py
   # Select option 3 for batch grading
   ```

4. **Review Results**
   - System provides automated measurements
   - You provide luster grade and defect notes
   - Results saved to SQLite database

### Calibration

Before first use, calibrate the system:

1. Place a known reference object (10mm sphere or coin) in frame
2. Run calibration mode in grader.py
3. System calculates pixels-to-mm conversion
4. Calibration data saved for future use

See [docs/calibration.md](docs/calibration.md) for detailed instructions.

```

## How It Works

### Size Measurement
1. Detect calibration marker in image
2. Calculate pixels-per-mm scaling factor
3. Identify pearl boundaries using edge detection
4. Measure diameter and convert to millimeters

### Shape Classification
1. Extract pearl contour
2. Calculate circularity metric: 4π × area / perimeter²
3. Classify based on thresholds:
   - Round: circularity > 0.95
   - Semi-Round: circularity > 0.85
   - Baroque: circularity < 0.85

### Color Analysis
1. Extract pearl region from image
2. Convert to HSV color space
3. Analyze hue distribution
4. Classify into Tahitian pearl color categories
